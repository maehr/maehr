Dr. sc. Moritz Mähr is an Associate Researcher in [Digital Humanities](https://www.dh.unibe.ch/) at the University of Bern and digital project manager of [Stadt.Geschichte.Basel](https://www.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/) at the University of Basel. His research bridges digital history, science and technology studies, and open infrastructure for the humanities.

His current agenda spans five areas:  
1. 🧠 **Digital Source Criticism in the Age of AI** – circumvent algorithmic bias in digitised and born-digital collections.  
2. 🌐 **Data Politics & Internet Governance** – the project *Exclusion by Design?* explores how global inequality was encoded into early Internet.  
3. 🗃️ **Histories of Digitisation** – history of the digitization of Swiss migration regime.  
4. 🏛️ **Public History Infrastructure** – low-barrier, open-source platforms like *Stadt.Geschichte.Basel* for FAIR/CARE storytelling and data reuse.  
5. 🌱 **Digital Sustainability** – embedding reproducibility, inclusivity, and ethical longevity into all scholarly workflows.

Moritz studied history, philosophy of knowledge, computer science, and finance in Zurich and Berlin, and earned his doctorate at ETH Zurich with a dissertation on the [digitization of Swiss migration authorities in the 1960s](https://doi.org/10.30965/9783657796823). He is an advocate for open science, open access, and open source.
